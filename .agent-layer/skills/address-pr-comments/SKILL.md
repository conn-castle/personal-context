# address-pr-comments

This is the PR comment resolution skill.
It should:
- read all PR comments (review comments and conversation comments)
- evaluate each piece of feedback
- implement fixes for agreed feedback
- prepare justifications for disagreed feedback
- audit all changes before committing
- commit and push
- reply to every feedback comment

## Defaults

- Default PR is the current branch's open PR.
- Default scope is all unresolved feedback comments on the PR.
- Pure bot status messages, CI notifications, and statements of fact (not feedback) are excluded from processing.
- Automated review comments from tools such as Copilot or CodeRabbit are treated as feedback and require replies, not excluded as bot messages.

## Inputs

Accept any combination of:
- a PR number or URL
- specific comment IDs to address
- pre-fetched comment data from the caller
- guidance on which comments to prioritize

## Required behavior

Delegate to:
- `audit-and-fix-uncommitted-changes` before committing

## Global constraints

- Every feedback comment must receive a reply. No exceptions.
- Only decline to implement a comment's suggestion when you genuinely believe it is wrong, harms the codebase, or is not actually beneficial or correct. Do not defer work as a reason to not implement.
- When agreeing with a comment, implement the fix and reply describing what was done.
- When disagreeing with a comment, reply with a clear, respectful justification explaining why the suggestion was not implemented.
- Do not batch-dismiss comments with generic responses. Each reply must be specific to the comment.

## Human checkpoints

- Required: ask when a comment requests a change that would require a materially broader scope or architectural decision.
- Required: ask when a comment's intent is ambiguous and could be interpreted multiple ways.
- When a checkpoint involves a genuine tradeoff between substantive alternatives, present at least two options with brief pros and cons, state which you recommend and why, and let the human decide.
- Stay autonomous when the feedback is clear and the fix or justification is straightforward.

## Comment resolution workflow

### Phase 1: Gather comments (Comment reader)

1. Read all PR comments using:
   - `gh pr view <pr-number> --comments` for conversation comments
   - `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr-number}/comments` for review (inline) comments
   - `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr-number}/reviews` for review bodies
2. Filter out:
   - bot-generated status messages and CI notifications
   - pure statements of fact that are not requesting or suggesting a change
   - comments that have already been resolved with a reply in a previous run of this skill
3. List each feedback comment with its ID, author, location (if inline), and content.

### Phase 2: Evaluate each comment (Evaluator)

For each feedback comment, decide:
- **Agree**: the suggestion is correct, beneficial, and should be implemented.
- **Disagree**: the suggestion is wrong, would harm the codebase, or is not actually beneficial or correct.

Evaluation rules:
- Do not disagree merely to avoid work.
- Do not disagree merely to defer the issue.
- Genuinely consider whether the suggestion improves correctness, readability, performance, or maintainability.
- If the comment points out a real issue but suggests the wrong fix, agree with the issue and implement a better fix.

### Phase 3: Implement agreed changes (Fixer)

1. Implement fixes for all agreed comments.
2. Keep changes focused on what each comment requested.
3. If multiple comments request related changes, group them logically.
4. If a comment's suggestion conflicts with another comment, note the conflict and ask if needed.

### Phase 4: Audit and commit (Auditor + Committer)

1. Use the `audit-and-fix-uncommitted-changes` skill to review and stabilize all changes.
2. Stage all changes: `git add -A`
3. Craft a commit message summarizing the comment-driven changes.
4. Commit and push.

### Phase 5: Reply to every comment (Replier)

1. For each agreed comment:
   - Reply describing the specific fix that was implemented.
   - Include the commit hash where the fix landed (e.g., "Fixed in abc1234").
2. For each disagreed comment:
   - Reply with a clear justification explaining why the suggestion was not implemented.
   - Be respectful and specific. Explain the reasoning, not just the conclusion.
3. Use the GitHub CLI or API to post replies:
   - For review comments: `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr-number}/comments/{comment-id}/replies -f body="<reply>"`
   - For conversation comments: `gh pr comment <pr-number> --body "<reply>"`

## Guardrails

- Do not leave any feedback comment without a reply.
- Do not use generic batch responses like "addressed all comments."
- Do not disagree with a comment just to avoid work or defer the issue.
- Do not implement changes that conflict with the project's established patterns without justification.
- Do not skip the audit-and-fix step before committing.
- Do not reply to comments before the changes are committed and pushed.

## Definition of done

- Every non-excluded feedback comment on the PR has a reply posted by this agent, with no generic batch responses.
- For every agreed comment, the implemented change is present in a pushed commit and the reply names that commit.
- For every disagreed comment, the reply contains a specific technical justification (not a deferral).
- The `audit-and-fix-uncommitted-changes` skill ran before the final commit, and all resulting changes are pushed to the PR branch.

## Final handoff

After all comments are addressed:
1. State how many comments were agreed with and fixed.
2. State how many comments were disagreed with and why (briefly).
3. Confirm all comments have replies.
4. State whether changes were pushed.
