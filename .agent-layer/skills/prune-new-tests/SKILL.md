# prune-new-tests

This skill prunes low-value tests that the implementing agent added as a side
effect of implementation. Each newly added test must defend its existence with
a **concrete mutation in production code that would flip the assertion**.
Tests that cannot are auto-deleted.

Use `audit-tests` instead when the target is the full existing suite. Use
`boost-coverage` instead when the goal is to **add** tests to raise coverage.
This skill never touches pre-existing tests.

## Defaults

- Default scope is **tests added in the current uncommitted diff only**
  (staged, unstaged, and untracked test files). Pre-existing tests are never
  touched.
- Default disposition is **delete unless justified**. The implementing agent
  did not earn a test's place by writing it; the test must demonstrate it can
  catch a defect.
- Tests are auto-deleted in place — no human approval per test. Surviving
  coverage gaps are reported, never backfilled with replacement assertions.

## Inputs

Accept any combination of:
- explicit paths or test files (still must intersect the added-test set)
- a per-test override list to keep without review
- a dry-run flag to produce the verdict report without deleting

## Required artifact

Write the report to:
- `.agent-layer/tmp/prune-new-tests.<run-id>.report.md`

Use `run-id = YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-<short-rand>`.
Create the file with `touch` before writing.

## Multi-agent pattern

Required roles:
1. `Diff scout`: enumerates every test added in the current uncommitted diff
   (added test files + new test functions inside existing files).
2. `Burden-of-proof reviewer` (fresh-context subagent): receives **only** the
   added test code, the production code it exercises, and the rubric below.
   It does **not** receive the implementer's narrative, the plan, the task
   list, or the prior conversation. Its job is to apply the rubric without
   inheriting the author's rationalizations.
3. `Applier`: deletes tests marked `delete`, runs the project test command
   afterward to confirm nothing unrelated broke, and writes the report.

The reviewer is invoked once per batch of added tests. If the batch is large,
split into chunks of related test files; each chunk gets its own fresh-context
invocation so the reviewer never accumulates context across chunks.

### Reviewer subagent prompt

Pass the contents of [`reviewer-prompt.md`](reviewer-prompt.md) to the
reviewer subagent verbatim — do not paraphrase, summarize, or modify the
rubric. Send no prior conversation, no plan, no implementer notes.

Inputs the reviewer receives alongside the prompt:
- The added test code (full text of new test files; for new functions in
  existing files, the function bodies plus minimal surrounding context).
- The production code each test exercises (named imports/symbols followed to
  their definitions; enough to judge what assertion would flip under what
  mutation).
- Nothing else. No plan, no task list, no context file, no implementer
  rationale, no prior reviewer output.

## Global constraints

- Operate only on tests **added** in the current uncommitted diff. Modified
  pre-existing tests are out of scope. Deleted tests are out of scope.
- Treat the reviewer subagent's verdicts as authoritative for `delete`
  decisions. The orchestrator does not second-guess deletions on its own.
- After applying deletions, run the project's repo-defined test command
  (consult `COMMANDS.md`) and observe the output. Record what ran and the
  outcome.
- Do not replace deleted tests with "stronger" tests in the same run. Report
  the resulting gap so a separate `boost-coverage` invocation can address it
  deliberately.
- Do not lower coverage thresholds or skip checks to clear failures. If a
  deletion causes a real coverage shortfall, surface it in the report.

## Human checkpoints

- Required: ask when the diff contains zero added tests — the skill has no
  work to do; confirm before exiting silently.
- Required: ask when the project has no discoverable test command in
  `COMMANDS.md` and no obvious convention — applier cannot verify deletions.
- Required: ask when applying deletions would empty a brand-new test file
  whose presence the user clearly intended (file added by user, not agent).
- Stay autonomous on all per-test `delete` verdicts within scope.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Enumerate added tests (Diff scout)

1. Run `git status --porcelain` and `git diff --cached`, `git diff`, and
   `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard` to find:
   - new test files (untracked or staged)
   - new test functions inside otherwise-pre-existing test files (diff
     hunks that add `func TestX`, `test('...')`, `it('...')`, `def test_*`,
     etc., according to the project's discovered test conventions)
2. Read `COMMANDS.md` to identify the test command for the verification
   step.
3. List each added test by file path, test name, and line range in the
   report under `## Added Tests`.

### Phase 2: Burden-of-proof review (Burden-of-proof reviewer)

1. Group added tests into review chunks (one test file or a small cluster
   of related files per chunk).
2. For each chunk, invoke the reviewer subagent with the contents of
   `reviewer-prompt.md` and the chunk inputs above. The subagent must be a
   fresh invocation with no carryover from this conversation.
3. Collect the JSON-line verdicts into the report under `## Verdicts` as a
   table with columns `Location`, `Name`, `Verdict`, `Justification`. The
   `Justification` column shows the `mutation` for `keep` and the `reason`
   for `delete`.

### Phase 3: Apply deletions (Applier)

1. Delete each `delete`-verdict test:
   - if a whole test file becomes empty, delete the file
   - if a function within a larger file is deleted, remove the function
     and any imports/fixtures that become unused as a result
2. Run the project's test command (from `COMMANDS.md`). Record the actual
   command and the observed result in the report.
3. If unrelated tests break, stop and surface the failure — do not
   "fix forward" by re-adding deleted tests or weakening assertions.

### Phase 4: Survival check (Applier)

1. Compute `survival = keep_count / total_added_tests`.
2. If `survival > 0.90`, flag the run as suspect under `## Survival Check`
   and note that the reviewer may be rubber-stamping. Recommend re-running
   with stricter rubric framing or splitting chunks more aggressively.
3. Otherwise, record the survival ratio for the audit trail.

### Phase 5: Report surviving coverage gaps (Applier)

For every deleted test, name the production behavior it nominally targeted
(from the reviewer's deletion `reason` and the test's original assertion).
List these under `## Surviving Coverage Gaps` so a follow-up `boost-coverage`
run can address them deliberately. Do **not** fabricate replacement
assertions in this run.

## Required report structure

Write `.agent-layer/tmp/prune-new-tests.<run-id>.report.md` with:

1. `# Prune New Tests Summary`
2. `## Scope`
3. `## Added Tests`
4. `## Verdicts`
   - table: `| Location | Name | Verdict | Justification |`
5. `## Deletions Applied`
   - one bullet per file or function actually removed
6. `## Test Run`
   - the exact command, observed exit status, and any unexpected breakage
7. `## Survival Check`
   - kept / total, ratio, and the suspect flag if `> 0.90`
8. `## Surviving Coverage Gaps`
   - behaviors that lost coverage and warrant a `boost-coverage` follow-up

## Guardrails

- Do not delete pre-existing tests, even when they look low-value. That is
  `audit-tests`'s domain and requires explicit opt-in.
- Do not preserve a test on the strength of the implementer's narrative.
  The reviewer never saw that narrative, and the orchestrator must not
  reintroduce it.
- Do not "improve" surviving tests during this skill's run. Improvements
  belong to a separate pass.
- Do not collapse multiple deleted tests into a single replacement test.
  That re-introduces agent-authored speculative coverage.
- Do not skip Phase 3 verification. A green test command is part of the
  contract.
- Do not silently widen scope to modified or pre-existing tests; surface
  them as out-of-scope observations instead.

## Definition of done

- The report exists at `.agent-layer/tmp/prune-new-tests.<run-id>.report.md`
  with every required section (`Scope`, `Added Tests`, `Verdicts`,
  `Deletions Applied`, `Test Run`, `Survival Check`, `Surviving Coverage
  Gaps`).
- Every added test in scope appears in the `Verdicts` table with one
  verdict and the required justification field populated.
- Every `delete` verdict is reflected by a matching entry under `Deletions
  Applied` and the corresponding test/function is gone from the working
  tree.
- `Test Run` records the exact command and its observed result; deletions
  did not introduce unrelated test failures.
- The survival ratio is recorded; if `> 0.90`, the suspect flag is set and
  the recommended next step is named.

## Final handoff

After writing the report:
1. Echo the report path.
2. State the total added tests and the kept/deleted counts.
3. Name the survival ratio and whether the suspect flag fired.
4. If `Surviving Coverage Gaps` is non-empty, recommend running
   `boost-coverage` against the listed behaviors.
