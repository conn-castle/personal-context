  Run the full PR lifecycle for completed local work: audit changes, commit,
  push, open PR, monitor CI, handle review comments, and finish green. Use when
  the user asks to ship, open, or take work to a PR. Use `fix-ci` for an
  existing failing PR, `address-pr-comments` for review feedback, and
  `finish-task` when no PR is needed.

# ship-pr

This is the PR lifecycle orchestrator.
It should:
- audit and commit any uncommitted changes
- push and create a PR
- monitor CI and fix failures
- wait for review comments
- address every feedback comment
- ensure CI passes at the end

## Defaults

- Default base branch is the repository's default branch (usually `main`).
- Default PR title and body are auto-generated from the branch name, commit history, and the work that was done.
- Default comment wait time is 15 minutes from PR creation.
- If explicit PR title, body, or base branch instructions are provided, use those instead of auto-generating.

## Inputs

Accept any combination of:
- explicit PR title
- explicit PR body or description instructions
- explicit base branch
- explicit comment wait time (default 15 minutes)
- whether to skip the comment wait period

## Required behavior

Delegate to:
- `audit-and-fix-uncommitted-changes` for pre-commit quality gates
- `fix-ci` for CI failure diagnosis and repair
- `address-pr-comments` for review comment handling

## Global constraints

- Do not create a PR if the current branch is the default branch and there is nothing to ship.
- Do not skip CI checks.
- Every feedback comment (not pure bot status messages or CI notifications) must have a reply before the skill completes. Automated review comments from tools such as Copilot or CodeRabbit count as feedback.
- The skill must end with CI passing.
- Do not force-push unless explicitly instructed.

## Human checkpoints

- Required: ask when the current branch is the default branch and there are no changes to ship (no uncommitted changes, no commits ahead of the remote, and no non-default branch to PR).
- If the working tree has no uncommitted changes but the current branch is not the default branch, proceed — the user is asking for a PR of the branch's commits.
- Required: ask when PR creation fails due to an existing PR or branch conflict.
- Required: ask when CI failures persist after 3 fix-ci iterations.
- When a checkpoint involves a genuine tradeoff between substantive alternatives, present at least two options with brief pros and cons, state which you recommend and why, and let the human decide.
- Stay autonomous during normal commit, push, PR creation, CI monitoring, and comment handling.

## Orchestration loop

### Phase 1: Prepare and push (Committer)

1. Determine the current branch and the repository's default branch.
2. Run `git status --porcelain` to check for uncommitted changes.
3. If uncommitted changes exist and the current branch is the default branch:
   a. Create a new branch with a descriptive name derived from the changes (e.g., `feat/add-widget-support` or `fix/null-pointer-in-parser`).
   b. Switch to the new branch before continuing.
4. If uncommitted changes exist:
   a. Use the `audit-and-fix-uncommitted-changes` skill to stabilize the working tree.
   b. Stage all changes: `git add -A`
   c. Craft a commit message that describes the work done.
   d. Commit the changes.
5. If no uncommitted changes exist and the current branch is not the default branch, proceed — the branch's existing commits are the content to ship.
6. If no uncommitted changes exist and the current branch is the default branch, trigger a human checkpoint — there is nothing to ship.
7. Push the branch to the remote.

### Phase 2: Create the PR (PR creator)

1. Check if a PR already exists for the current branch using `gh pr view`.
2. If no PR exists:
   a. Auto-generate the PR title from the branch name and commit history, unless explicit title was provided.
   b. Auto-generate the PR body summarizing what was done, unless explicit body was provided.
   c. Create the PR: `gh pr create --title "<title>" --body "<body>" --base <base-branch>`
3. If a PR already exists, use that PR.
4. Record the PR number/URL and the current time as `start_time`.

### Phase 3: Wait for CI and fix failures (CI monitor)

1. Poll CI status using `gh pr checks <pr-number>`.
2. Wait for all CI checks to complete.
3. If any CI check failed:
   a. Use the `fix-ci` skill, passing the PR number.
   b. The fix-ci skill handles the internal loop of diagnose, fix, audit, commit, push, re-check.
4. CI must be passing before proceeding.

### Phase 4: Wait for review comments (Timer)

The review-comment wait timer starts at PR creation (`start_time` from Phase 2). Time spent waiting for CI in Phase 3 counts toward this timer.

1. Calculate elapsed time since `start_time`.
2. If less than 15 minutes (or the configured wait time) have elapsed, wait for the remaining time.
3. If the wait time has already elapsed (e.g., CI took longer than the wait period), proceed immediately.

### Phase 5: Address PR comments (Comment handler)

1. Read all PR comments (review comments and conversation comments).
2. Filter out pure bot status messages and CI notifications. Automated review comments from tools such as Copilot or CodeRabbit are feedback, not status messages.
3. If there are feedback comments to address:
   a. Use the `address-pr-comments` skill, passing the PR number and all feedback comments.
   b. The address-pr-comments skill handles implementation, audit, commit, push, and replies.
   c. Every feedback comment must receive a reply.
4. If no feedback comments exist, proceed.

### Phase 6: Final CI verification (CI monitor)

1. If changes were pushed in Phase 5:
   a. Wait for CI to complete.
   b. If CI fails, use the `fix-ci` skill again.
   c. Repeat until CI passes.
2. Confirm CI is green.

### Phase 7: Audit comment coverage (Comment auditor)

Independently verify that every review comment was properly handled. Do not
trust the sub-skill output alone — re-read the PR state and validate.

1. Re-fetch all PR comments (review comments, conversation comments, and review
   bodies) using the same commands from Phase 5 / the address-pr-comments skill.
2. For every feedback comment, verify:
   a. A reply exists from this agent (not just from a human or bot).
   b. The reply opens with one of the three bold verdicts defined in
      "Comment reply format" below.
   c. If the verdict is **Fixed**, the named commit exists and contains a
      relevant change.
   d. If the verdict is **No change**, the justification is substantive and
      technically grounded — not vague or generic.
   e. If the verdict is **Deferred**, the named location actually contains
      the tracked item, and the deferral is legitimate (not a bug introduced
      by this PR).
3. Flag any comment that fails verification:
   - **Missing reply:** never responded to.
   - **Missing verdict:** reply exists but does not open with a bold verdict.
   - **Hollow fix:** verdict says "Fixed" but no code change exists in the
     named commit.
   - **Unjustified decline:** verdict says "No change" but the justification
     is vague, generic, or missing.
   - **Lazy deferral:** verdict says "Deferred" but the item is not actually
     tracked, or the comment points to a bug introduced by this PR.
   - **Generic dismissal:** batch-style reply covering multiple comments
     rather than addressing each specifically.
4. If any comments are flagged:
   a. Re-address them: implement the fix or write a proper justification.
   b. Audit, commit, and push the new changes.
   c. Post a follow-up reply on each re-addressed comment. If a previously declined suggestion was subsequently implemented, acknowledge the reversal and describe the concrete change.
   d. Re-run this phase to confirm all flags are resolved.
5. Only proceed when every feedback comment passes verification.

### Phase 8: Close the run (Reporter)

1. Confirm:
   - CI is passing
   - every comment has a reply that passes the Phase 7 audit
   - all changes are committed and pushed
2. Summarize the PR lifecycle outcome.

## Comment reply format

Every reply to a review comment must open with a **bold verdict** on one line,
followed by a concise justification. There are exactly three verdicts:

1. **Fixed in `<short-hash>`.** — The suggestion was implemented. Describe the
   concrete change.
2. **No change — `<reason>`.** — The suggestion was evaluated and declined.
   `<reason>` is a short label: `by design`, `pre-existing behavior`,
   `not a regression`, `testability`, etc. Follow with the technical
   justification.
3. **Deferred — tracked in `<location>`.** — The suggestion has merit but is
   out of scope. `<location>` names where it was recorded (e.g.,
   `ISSUES.md`, `BACKLOG.md`, a GitHub issue link). The suggestion must
   actually be recorded there before using this verdict.

Do not use "deferred" as a way to avoid doing work that belongs in this PR.
A comment is only legitimately deferred when:
- It requests a new feature or enhancement beyond the PR's scope.
- It identifies a pre-existing issue not introduced by this PR.
- Fixing it would require a non-trivial refactor unrelated to the PR's purpose.

If the suggestion points to a bug or correctness issue introduced by this PR,
it must be fixed, not deferred.

## Guardrails

- Do not skip the audit-and-fix step before committing.
- Do not leave any feedback comment without a reply.
- Do not end with CI failing.
- Do not force-push or rewrite history unless explicitly instructed.
- Do not create duplicate PRs.
- If a previously declined suggestion is subsequently implemented, the follow-up reply must acknowledge the reversal.

## Definition of done

- A PR exists for the current branch and `gh pr checks` shows every required CI check passing on the final pushed commit.
- Every feedback comment (excluding pure bot status/CI notifications) has a reply that opens with one of the three bold verdicts (`Fixed in <hash>`, `No change — <reason>`, `Deferred — tracked in <location>`) and passes the Phase 7 audit.
- Phase 7 was executed by re-fetching the PR state; no comment is flagged as missing reply, hollow fix, unjustified decline, lazy deferral, or generic dismissal at close.
- The skill did not force-push, did not create a duplicate PR, and did not end with CI failing.

## Final handoff

After the run:
1. Echo the PR URL.
2. Summarize: what was committed, CI status, comments addressed.
3. State whether all comments passed the Phase 7 audit or if any require further human attention.
4. If any comments were re-addressed during the audit, list them and explain what was corrected.
